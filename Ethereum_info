What is ETHEREUM?

Ethereum is an open-source software framework which is based on blockchain technology. Blockchain is a public ledger that keeps
a shared history of all the transactions distributed across a vast network of users. Ethereum is the biggest decentralized
software app. You can build smart contracts and decentralized applications without any downtime or any third-party interference.

Why do you need it?

CENTRALIZED systems are one of the most widespread models for software applications. This system directly controls the operation
of the individual units and flow of information from a single center. In such a system, individuals are depended on the central
power to send and receive information. Some issues that appear in a centralized system are:
* single point of control & failure
* it can be corrupt easily
* performance bottleneck
DECENTRALIZED applications never reply on a centralized backend, but they interact directly with a blockchain. 

ETHEREUM KEY TERMS:
- Currency issuance: it is mostly managed and monitored  by a country's central bank
- Decentralized Autonomous: Decentralized Autonomous Organization is a digital organization which aims to operate without the 
need for hierarchical management
- Organizations(DAO): DAO is a combination of computer code, a blockchain, smart contracts, and people
- Smart Contracts: it is digitally signed agreement between two or more parties which relies on a consensus system
- Smart Property: the Ethreum Wallet is a gateway to decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain
- Solidity: Solidity is the smart contact language used in Ethereum 
- Transactions: A transaction is a message which is sent from one account to another account that may be the same or empty
- Ethereum Virtual Machine: EVM is the runtimme environment for smart contracts; the running code inside the EVM does not 
have any access to network, filesystem or other processes
